Module 8 Challenge - Vehicle-Builder_app 
I had to modify a starter code and update it to createa Vehicle Builder app using the command line 
I have to gather User's inputs and rturn the user to the menu until they choose to exit application

The application is involked by using npm start in the command line terminal 

USER STORY 
AS a developer
I WANT to update an existing application to include additional vehicle types
SO THAT I am able to comprehend and work with existing code bases.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA 
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted to create a new vehicle or existing vehicle
THEN I can choose between the two options
WHEN I am prompted to choose the vehicle type during creation
THEN I can choose between car, truck, and motorbike
WHEN I am prompted for details about the vehicle
THEN I can enter the vehicle information
WHEN I have entered all the vehicle information
THEN I can use the created vehicle
WHEN I select an existing vehicle
THEN I can use the selected existing vehicle
WHEN I have created a new vehicle or selected an existing vehicle
THEN I can perform actions with that vehicle
WHEN I perform an action with a vehicle
THEN I see the result of the action in the command-line
